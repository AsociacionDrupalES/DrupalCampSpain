## File structure
`src` contains all raw sass, images and js files.
`dist` contains all compiled sass to css, images and js files (so if you want to refer to a js file use ./dist instead ./src)

We use yarn for compilations. `yarn install` to setup the node environment and `yarn build` or `yarn watch` for development.
