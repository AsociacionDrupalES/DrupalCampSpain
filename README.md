## Use "Coming soon" landing page
- Go to `admin/config/system/site-information` and set `/coming-soon` as "Default front page".
when you are ready to release the real page go to `admin/config/system/site-information` and set `/node/1` as "Default front page".  
NOTE: If you want to modyfy the landing page go to `web/modules/custom/event_coming_soon_landing_page/templates/coming-soon-landing-page.html.twig`. in this module you will find all HTML and used assets for the landing page.
